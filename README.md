# Protein-Digest-Project
'Spliceapp' is a simple web application I created, which takes a protein sequence, "splices" it into fragments, and displays the fragments neatly in a table. It does so according to the rules of a selected enzyme, and also editting the results based on user inputs: a. The number of "missed cleavages" which is acceptable. and: b. Legnth and weight restrictions for the resulting fragments.

This folder contains the zipped complete application, which runs on TurboGears. Hence, I ran it from the commandline, using the 'tgserve' command. The folder also contains the salient modules that I spent most of my time working on: 'splicemod.py' and 'spliceapp.py'. It also contains the modified index and root files, and the 'dice.html' template. I can't claim to be an expert in web development, and must admit that I leaned heavily on course materials for this portion of the project, but the modules executing the actual "work" were planned and executed independently.
